#OfCourse

OfCourse is a website that aims to offer easy access to information about LA Tech. The current website is awful, especially for finding courses that you may be interested in, so hopefully this will make it a little more bearable.

Currently under development when I have free time, and I don't feel like dealing with vagrant and setting up testing environments right now, so the site may or may not work when you go to it. Sorry!

##Goals

Eventually, students will be able to easily query the data base to find information. A lot of things could easily be found via a "my search site:latech.edu", but few students know how to do that or want to. So eventually this site will allow them to search for "engineering professors who teach ENGR 120" or "popular Engineering professors that teach a class from 8:00 to 10:00" and things along those lines. It'll be fun.

## Difficulties

So LA TEch doesn't want to give me SELECT access to their databases (what, giving database access to a freshman is  a bad idea? huh?) so I'm scraping data from the website to generate these tables. Which means any development on the site depends on break-throughs on the backend.

Currently available at (http://myfoot.org)[http://myfoot.org], but may be moved whenever I want to host another project on a new domain.
